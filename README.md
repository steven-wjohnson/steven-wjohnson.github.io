Steven Johnson Professional Portfolio

The goal of the project is to build a single page website that is dedicated to exposing potential employers to myself as a developer. It should answer the following questions: Who am I? What are the skills I have attained that help to qualify me as a professional web developer? What have I built to learn and showcase these skills? How can a potential employer get in contact with me?

Functional Requirements:

A user can navigate to information about myself as a developer.
A user can find my projects and be able to visualize them.
A user can find the best ways to contact me.
A user can read about the skills and technologies that I currently have developed.

Non functional requirements:

The page should be easy to read so that users can find what they are looking for.
The page should be mobile ready so it can be accessed on many devices on the web.
The page should have as few dependencies so that no more than an hour a week is required to maintain it. 
The page should load in less than 3 seconds on any modern browser.
The page should be hosted with Github Pages to enable easy and affordable maintenance.
The page should require no more than 2 clicks to get to any important information from anywhere.
